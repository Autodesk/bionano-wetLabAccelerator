- cloud lab = cloud computing for experiments
- automated, robotically-controlled experiments
- make digitally available data + process
- translate physical process to visual to construct mental map 
- accomodate data exploration, interpretation, concentration
- machine learning from algorithms toward rational design
- Design, Build, Test, Learn -> Rational Design, Automated Build, High-throughput Test, Machine Learn




Lab automation, provided by cloud laboratories like Transcriptic, enable a new paradigm of science, in which protocols are automated and performed robotically, and experiments are inherently verifiable and replicable. CX1 presents an interface for designing, visualizing, managing, and distributing protocols, which makes lab automation more accessible to biologists, eliminating the need for programming expertise or an expensive facility. 

Though the cloud lab is analogous cloud computing, there are unique challenges in digitally representing the remote, physical process, and in accommodating the user's needs in data interpretation, exploration, and analysis. 

Extensible protocols which generate schematized data can supply machine learning algorithms, which traditionally are difficult to heterologous biological experimental data. CX1 provides a framework which facilitates the transformation of Design, Build, Test, Learn of biological systems to Rational Design, Automated Build, High-throughput Test, and Machine Learn.

To demonstrate the utility of the CX1 application, a process-development pipeline was implemented to reliably direct the assembly and characterization of a synthetic PhiX174 bacteriophage through an Escherichia coli plaque assay. 




Cloud laboratories has the potential to democratize education of biology, by removing the need to purchase expensive equipment, access a biosafety-certified lab, or dedicate time to perform experiments manually.

OLD VERSION

Although the Design, Build, Test, Learn cycle of synthetic biology has led to the integration of engineering principles and biological R&D, the majority of such research is carried out manually within academic laboratories. Recent advances in design automation have led to the creation of cloud-based biological laboratories such as Transcriptic, where the Build and Test components of the research development cycle can be automated by robotic operations. Although Transcriptic  provides a method for laboratory automation, a section of potential users lack the computer programming expertise required to translate laboratory practices to robotic operations. To augment the rise of the cloud-based robotic laboratory Transcriptic and its corresponding Autoprotocol language , a web-based application called CX1 was constructed to provide a framework for designing, visualizing, controlling, and distributing json-based Autoprotocol constructs with ease in the cloud. To demonstrate the utility of the CX1 application, a process-development pipeline was implemented to reliably direct the assembly and characterization of a synthetic PhiX174 bacteriophage through an Escherichia coli plaque assay.
