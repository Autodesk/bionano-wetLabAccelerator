## ng-transcriptify

Angular Transcriptic UI

### TODO


- pipette steps
  - passage of form in

- support high level ordering API

- scaffolds for each instruction? or just add required for templates?

- Protocol UI
  - refs need to be converted to class from JSON for within directive
  - adding instructions
  - sorting instructions
  
- verify mix template

#### Pretty + Nice features

- allow passage of object as attrs for input in tx-measure -- need to support input[type] though
    
- better well UI

- move away from selects to some other dropdown?

- wire up so can actually send a protocol

- add in notes / catches etc.

- google analytics


#### JS Autoprotcol

- kinda separate from UI... ability to create steps programmatically

- look into Haxe, migrating Autoprotocol into it
