## ng-transcriptify

Angular Transcriptic UI

### TODO

- autoprotocol-like protocol factory (basic version initially)
  - how to scale for each method? esp. re: UI
  - may need separate UI for each step? at least a way of capturing step-specific metadata

- get json-editor directive in sync

- move away from selects to some other dropdown?

- Protocol UI
  - refs need to be converted to class from JSON for within directive
  - adding instructions
  - sorting instructions

- wire up so can actually send a protocol

- add in notes / catches etc.

- google analytics

- look into Haxe, migrating Autoprotocol into it
