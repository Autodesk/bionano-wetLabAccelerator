## ng-transcriptify

Angular Transcriptic UI

### TODO

- enable addition of arbitrary instructions in protocol - drag and drop
  - scaffolds for each instruction? or just add required for templates?

- support high level ordering API

- list of containers, projects, etc. for side?

- json editor - have a save so that model doesn't reposition cursor, but need to validate

#### Pretty + Nice features

- refactor tx-measure
  - need to support input[type] + ideally other input attributes
  - maybe as attribute directive? but need dropdown or something
  - allow passage of object as attrs for input?

- better well UI

- move away from selects to some other dropdown?

- add in notes / catches etc., 
  - ngMessages for errors / warnings. 
  - Better required / optional markers

- google analytics


#### JS Autoprotcol

- kinda separate from UI... ability to create steps programmatically

- look into Haxe, migrating Autoprotocol into it
