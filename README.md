## ng-transcriptify

Angular Transcriptic UI

### TODO

- pipette steps
  - verify mix
  - do transfer
  
- thermocycle step

- support high level ordering API

- enable deletion / duplication of steps

- enable addition of arbitrary instructions in protocol
  - scaffolds for each instruction? or just add required for templates?  

- enable sorting of steps (ui-sortable is easy)

- fix tx-well blur issue

#### Pretty + Nice features

- allow passage of object as attrs for input in tx-measure -- need to support input[type] though
    
- better well UI

- move away from selects to some other dropdown?

- add in notes / catches etc.

- google analytics


#### JS Autoprotcol

- kinda separate from UI... ability to create steps programmatically

- look into Haxe, migrating Autoprotocol into it
