## ng-transcriptify

Angular Transcriptic UI

### TODO

- Ref class, migrate logic in from directive

- autoprotocol-like protocol factory (basic version initially)
  - how to scale for each method? esp. re: UI
  - may need separate UI for each step? at least a way of capturing step-specific metadata

- UI for constructing protocol
  - reference `refs`
  - smooth out `tx-measure` directive

- wire up sending protocol

- add in notes / catches etc.

- look into Haxe, migrating Autoprotocol into it
